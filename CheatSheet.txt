# how to change the date format
# pd = pandas
pd.to_datetime(DataName_name['date_format_name']).dt.strftime('%d-%m-%Y')

!! Report paper !!

Main Paper on google doc

API Have Limitation
- Use time.sleep() to over come the problem

Finding the r val

Should organized more
- Have some structure for the coded
- Write down idea before commiting

How good library is 
- Pandas is OP
- Look through the documentation first (Might have what you're looking for)

API Not giving any information
- Sometimes the API give you an empty error

API Is not perfect
- No total lap number
- Need other method to get it

--------------------------------------------------

!! TO CODE LIST !!

- Remove all the unwanted var
- Add another var to the whole func

--------------------------------------------------

!! Milestone 2 !!

Your project in short
- Data analysis on factors contributing to F1 Racing
- Gather Data from API
- Use python to analyze it
- See the correlation between data

Your research so far
- Pearson Correlation
- Compare some data

Your tests and implementations so far
    Pearson Correlation (Explaination)
        - High: Height vs Weight
        - Low: Show Size vs IQ
- Test between couple of variables
- Using pearson correlation
test asdf

Any blockers or impediments and risk assessments.
- API Limitation
- Choosing the right vairables to compare
- Choosing the right algorithm

Your anticipations on the outcome of the project.
- Be able to see correlation between variables 
- Understand different correlation methods

Where to go from here
- Find a way to clean the data
- Find a way to organized the data
- Make a function that test all variables rank the correlation

--------------------------------------------------

!! COMPARISION IDEA !!

Lap time vs. finishing position 
Top speed vs. final ranking 
Qualifying position vs. race result 
Number of pit stops vs. race time 
Tyre compound vs. lap time 

--------------------------------------------------

!! TO DO LIST !!

X Get all the driver number within the same key 

Put everything into excel
{API Method Name}_{Session Keys}

Generate A Table
- Driver Data
- Circuit
- Year
- Position
- Speed
- Qualifying Position
- Pit Duration
- Tyre Compound
- Weather
- Qualifying Position (SessionData)


Compare Two Val

Func that return r val and possible display some image

--------------------------------------------------

!! ORGANIZATION !!
